Or you can buy an ultrasonic possum repeller, but they don't work (I tried one â€” useless).\r\n\r\nIn the end I worked out my own solution (picture http://i.imgur.com/nlNpO84.jpg ). It's a possum deterrent that\r\n\r\n    does not cost much (~$25 in parts)\r\n    does not exert force or damaging friction on the power cable (or any cable)\r\n    is durable\r\n    works\r\n\r\nAll you need is a 1m long piece of K-Flex 9 x 25mm x 1m Fire Rated Elastomeric Pipe Insulation (http://www.bunnings.com.au/k-flex-9-x-32mm-x-1m-fire-rated-elastomeric-pipe-insulation-_p4920092) from Bunnings, a packet of stainless steel nails http://www.bunnings.com.au/paslode-25-x-2-0mm-250g-stainless-steel-fibre-cement-nails-330-pack_p2360521  (they won't rust) and 4 longish cable ties http://www.bunnings.com.au/crescent-300-x-4-8mm-black-cable-ties-25-pack_p4431201 .\r\n\r\nCut off about a 370mm piece of insulation to use, then cut it lengthwise with scissors to allow it to go over the cable. Now push the nails through from the inside of the foam outwards, trying to get as many in as you can. I used about 70% of that packet. Leave a little unused patch of foam at the beginning and end for your cable ties to tie it to the power line.\r\n\r\nSlip it over the cable and secure with a cable tie on each end, and two even spaced in the middle to stop it bulging open and allowing the possum to insert a paw there.\r\n\r\nSo far, 3 months and we have not had a possum on the roof!\r\n\r\nI was in no danger at all by installing this soft cuff around a well insulated cable. Do not put your hands anywhere on the cable or posts, get someone to hold the base of the ladder so you can use 2 hands. I never actually touched the cable, and the only thing now resting on the cable is the very soft foam tube.\r\n\r\nIt was worth it because the darned possums chew the cables on my solar panels and urinate/defecate onto the roof, which feeds into my water tank.\r\n\r\nSome people say it's dangerous to do this, but that's bollocks. You don't need to actually touch the cable (quite apart from the fact that animals like possums spend their lives running up and down these \"dangerous\" cables). The insulation on the cable is several mm thick. Danger of shock: infinitesimal. The only real danger is being high up on a ladder.\r\n\r\nPermissible? No, not currently. Power companies don't want every Joe Sixpack attaching gizmoes to their cables, and that's understandable, given the things some people have done http://lh3.ggpht.com/-AL36FwjOzt4/UfT8qXBBxEI/AAAAAAAADxA/BLOjpzfrlf8/s1600-h/P1020951%25255B3%25255D.jpg , so they have blanket rules about nothing being attached to their cables. But you can see my device is harmless, or you should be able to see that if you have any technical or scientific training.\r\n\r\nIf you call the power company and complain about the possums chewing out your solar panel cables and shitting in your drinking water, they tell you to take a hike. Amount of sympathy = zero. Don't bother ....",
